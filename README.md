# VAGABOND

This Vagabond Website was created by Regelyn Cacho, Ivan Miranda, and Kody Lawton as part of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.

Sign in to uncover a community of foodies posting comments and feedback on cities they've been (pre-listed on the website) to and the food around them.

## Technology

This web-based application utilizes Ruby v. 2.2.6, Ruby on Rails, and is deployed to Heroku. It also features styling using the Bootstrap library and jquery. Postgresql was used for the database. Bcrypt was used for password encryption. 

## Future Features

Possible future features include being able to respond to feedback and being able to upload pictures to the profile, comments, and feedbacks easily, probably though an embedded widget such as Uploadcare.
